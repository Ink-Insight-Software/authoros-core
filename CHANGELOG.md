# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- `progression/progression_domain.dart` and `image_media_type.dart` join the
  core, as they did in AOS-Write for ADR-0028: the database needs them before
  it can leave the application for `authoros_persistence`. Pure Dart, and
  carried over with their history.

## 0.1.0

- The package as it stood in AOS-Write at the move: the record engine, the
  archive and the continuity model. Only `resolution: workspace` was removed
  from `pubspec.yaml`, so it resolves on its own.
